<!--  
 This is the Solr schema file. This file should be named "schema.xml" and
 should be in the conf directory under the solr home
 (i.e. ./solr/conf/schema.xml by default) 
 or located where the classloader for the Solr webapp can find it.

 This example schema is the recommended starting point for users.
 It should be kept correct and concise, usable out-of-the-box.

 For more information, on how to customize this file, please see
 http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SchemaXml

 PERFORMANCE NOTE: this schema includes many optional features and should not
 be used for benchmarking.  To improve performance one could
  - set stored="false" for all fields possible (esp large fields) when you
    only need to search on the field but don't need to return the original
    value.
  - set indexed="false" if you don't need to search on the field, but only
    return the field as a result of searching on other indexed fields.
  - remove all unneeded copyField statements
  - for best index size and searching performance, set "index" to false
    for all general text fields, use copyField to copy them to the
    catchall "text" field, and use that for searching.
  - For maximum indexing performance, use the ConcurrentUpdateSolrServer
    java client.
  - Remember to run the JVM in server mode, and use a higher logging level
    that avoids logging every request

<schema name="stockHistory" version="1.5">
    <!-- attribute "name" is the name of this schema and is only used for display purposes.
         version="x.y" is Solr's version number for the schema syntax and
         semantics.  It should not normally be changed by applications.

         1.0: multiValued attribute did not exist, all fields are multiValued
              by nature
         1.1: multiValued attribute introduced, false by default
         1.2: omitTermFreqAndPositions attribute introduced, true by default
              except for text fields.
         1.3: removed optional field compress feature
         1.4: autoGeneratePhraseQueries attribute introduced to drive QueryParser
              behavior when a single string produces multiple tokens.  Defaults
              to off for version >= 1.4
         1.5: omitNorms defaults to true for primitive field types
              (int, float, boolean, string...)
       -->


    <!-- Valid attributes for fields:
      name: mandatory - the name for the field
      type: mandatory - the name of a field type from the
        <types> fieldType section
      indexed: true if this field should be indexed (searchable or sortable)
      stored: true if this field should be retrievable
      docValues: true if this field should have doc values. Doc values are
        useful for faceting, grouping, sorting and function queries. Although not
        required, doc values will make the index faster to load, more
        NRT-friendly and more memory-efficient. They however come with some
        limitations: they are currently only supported by StrField, UUIDField
        and all Trie*Fields, and depending on the field type, they might
        require the field to be single-valued, be required or have a default
        value (check the documentation of the field type you're interested in
        for more information)
      multiValued: true if this field may contain multiple values per document
      omitNorms: (expert) set to true to omit the norms associated with
        this field (this disables length normalization and index-time
        boosting for the field, and saves some memory).  Only full-text
        fields or fields that need an index-time boost need norms.
        Norms are omitted for primitive (non-analyzed) types by default.
      termVectors: [false] set to true to store the term vector for a
        given field.
        When using MoreLikeThis, fields used for similarity should be
        stored for best performance.
      termPositions: Store position information with the term vector.
        This will increase storage costs.
      termOffsets: Store offset information with the term vector. This
        will increase storage costs.
      required: The field is required.  It will throw an error if the
        value does not exist
      default: a value that should be used if no value is specified
        when adding a document.

    <!-- field names should consist of alphanumeric or underscore characters only and
       not start with a digit.  This is not currently strictly enforced,
       but other field names will not have first class support from all components
       and back compatibility is not guaranteed.  Names with both leading and
       trailing underscores (e.g. _version_) are reserved.

      required, it is highly recommended. A <uniqueKey> is present in almost all Solr
      installations. See the <uniqueKey> declaration below where <uniqueKey> is set to "id".

    <field name="text" type="text" indexed="true" stored="true" required="true" multiValued="true" />

    <!--
      Some fields such as popularity and manu_exact could be modified to
      leverage doc values:
      <field name="popularity" type="int" indexed="true" stored="true" docValues="true" />
      <field name="manu_exact" type="string" indexed="false" stored="false" docValues="true" />
      <field name="cat" type="string" indexed="true" stored="true" docValues="true" multiValued="true"/>


      Although it would make indexing slightly slower and the index bigger, it
      would also make the index faster to load, more memory-efficient and more
      NRT-friendly.

    <!-- Dynamic field definitions allow using convention over configuration

     which takes precedence over this.

     in solrconfig.xml defines "df", which takes precedence. That would need to be removed.

     The default is OR, which is generally assumed so it is not a good idea to change it
     globally here.  The "q.op" request parameter takes precedence over this.
